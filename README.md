## Reference:

This is when i was doing an online specialization sources in python from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) here is the ref [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) . Had a great experience with [Dr-Chuck](https://www.dr-chuck.com/).

I completed my specialization and learn a lot.

I'm very proud of this small piece of code, this is the first time when i interacted with any external api.
